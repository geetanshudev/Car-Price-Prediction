This project implements a car price prediction model using Flask in Python. Users can input car details and receive an estimated price prediction.

Prerequisites

* Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* pip (package installer for Python) - usually comes bundled with Python
* Required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   python carapp.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` .

Usage

The application provides a form where you can enter car details. Fill in the fields and submit the form. The predicted price will be displayed on the same page.

Note:

* The accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality of the underlying machine learning model and the data used for training.
* This is a basic example, and you may need to customize it further based on your specific model and data.

Additional Information

* requirements.txt : This file lists the required Python libraries for the project.
* carapp.py : This is the main Flask application file. It defines the routes, handles form data, and interacts with the prediction model.
* car_price_model.joblib : This file  contains the code for machine learning model (e.g., training, loading).
